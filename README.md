#Hardware workshop

Aim: To have fun with microcontroller boards like Arduino!
From lighting up a LED to getting measurements from a sensor.


## Intro

Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform firstly aimed at the general public. [[Read more]](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)

It is usually programmed using the Arduino programming language on the Arduino IDE. But it can also be programmed using C++ or C.[[Read more]](https://gist.github.com/baalexander/8530398)

Arduino makes it accessible to programme microcontrollers. It is a good way to get started with robotics, experiment, or build prototypes.


## Install

To avoid installation issue (aaah, software!) we'll use the CodeBender platform.
You can create an account [here](https://codebender.cc/)!
CodeBender is a cross-platform web based editor for microcontroller boards. It helps you write, compile and upload code to your board.
